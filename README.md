# Playground
This contains a few mini projects that I have worked on during my free time. The project lists includes:
- Data Transformation, transforming a circular data into a linear separable data
- Genetic Algorithm, a simple genetic algorithm that is able to search for the expected word starting from jibberish

NOTE: There might be refactors in the code that may change overtime as I find better way to structure the code
